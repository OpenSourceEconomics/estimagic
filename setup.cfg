long_description =
            Estimagic is a Python package that helps to build high-quality and user
            friendly implementations of (structural) econometric models.

            It is designed with large structural models in mind. However, it is also
            useful for any other estimator that numerically minimizes or maximizes a
            criterion function (Extremum Estimator). Examples are maximum likelihood
            estimation, generalized method of moments, method of simulated moments and
            indirect inference.
