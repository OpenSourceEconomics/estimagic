How-To Guides
=============

Here we collect user written How-To Guides. How-To Guides come in the form of a jupyter
notebook. They should be:

- Goal oriented: Only describe what is necessary to achieve a goal. If you want, you can
  add links to background information at the end.
- Have minimal setups: If you show how to maximize a function, the function
  should be a one-liner and not a likelihood function that requires a lot of background
  information.
