Estimagic enhancement proposals
===============================


Large changes to estimagic can be proposed in estimagic enhancement proposals, short
EEPs. They serve the purpose of summarising discussions
that may happen in chats, issues, pull requests, in person, or by any other means.
Simple extensions (like adding new optimizers) do not need to be discussed with such
a formal process.


These EEPs are currently in place:
