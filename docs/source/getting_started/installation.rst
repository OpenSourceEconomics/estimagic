============
Installation
============


The package can be installed via conda. To do so, type the following commands in
a terminal or shell:

``$ conda config --add channels conda-forge``
``$ conda install -c janosg estimagic``

The first line adds conda-forge to your conda channels. This is necessary for
conda to find all dependencies of estimagic. The second line installs estimagic
and its dependencies.

Estimagic is not and will not be pip installable because it has so many
dependencies that it would be really hard to install via pip.
