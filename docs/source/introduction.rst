Introduction
============


Estimagic is a Python package that helps to build high-quality and user
friendly implementations of (structural) econometric models.

It is designed with large structural models in mind. However, it is also
useful for any other estimator that numerically minimizes or maximizes a
criterion function (Extremum Estimator). Examples are maximum likelihood
estimation, generalized method of moments, method of simulated moments and
indirect inference.

The highlights of estimagic are:

Estimation
==========

Collect a wide range methods for global and local optimization with a unified
interface. This interface makes it easy to specify complex termination
criteria and common types of constraints in an intuitive way - even for
optimization algorithms that are originally unconstrained.

On top of the optimizer collection we provide methods to diagnose if a
(global) optimization was successful. Moreover, we make it easy to monitor or
pause and restart long running optimizations and to save intermediate results.


Inference
=========

Calculate several types of standard errors and confidence intervals for any
extremum estimator.

1) asymptotic standard errors based on gradients and hessians.
2) computationally feasible bootstrap methods such as the wild score boostrap.
3) confidence intervals based on the profile-likelihood method.



Automate the boring stuff
=========================

Provide re-usable code blocks that make it faster to write structural models.
These include but are not limited to helpers for the following tasks:

- Building criterion functions out of moment conditions
- Process model specifications
- Writing LaTeX tables
- Specify and estimate common auxiliary models for indirect inference
- Model diagnostics

Give you freedom
================

Using estimagic for estimation and inference only requires criterion functions
with a compatible interface. In contrast to other packages there are no
further requirements. For example, we do not ask you to subclass anything or
to follow a certain programming style.

Given these conditions, users can fully abstract from the details of
optimization and numerical differentiation and be sure that they are using
state of the art methods. Of course, it is also possible to configure every
detail of the algorithms if desired.
