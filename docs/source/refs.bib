  abstract   = {A new global optimization algorithm for functions of continuous variables is presented,
derived from the “Simulated Annealing” algorithm recently introduced in combinatorial
optimization.The algorithm is essentially an iterative random search procedure with
adaptive moves along the coordinate directions. It permits uphill moves under the
control of a probabilistic criterion, thus tending to avoid the first local minima
encountered.The algorithm has been tested against the Nelder and Mead simplex method
and against a version of Adaptive Random Search. The test functions were Rosenbrock
valleys and multiminima functions in 2,4, and 10 dimensions.The new method proved
to be more reliable than the others, being always able to find the optimum, or at
least a point very close to it. It is quite costly in term of function evaluations,
but its cost can be predicted in advance, depending only slightly on the starting
point.},
