Actual improvement / expected improvement is large. 
Accept the new point, increase trust region radius
Actual improvement / expected improvement < 1, but still large
Accept new point, increase trust region radius
Actual improvement / expected improvement is negative
Do not new accept point, decrease trust region radius
Actual improvement / expected improvement is around 1
Accept new point, increase trust region
Actual improvement / expected improvement is around 1
Accept new point, increase trust region
Convergence is somewhere here
The algorithm would converge soon because of a zero gradient
