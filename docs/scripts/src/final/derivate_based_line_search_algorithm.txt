Initial evaluation: large gradient, low curvature 
Make a big stepIteration 1: large gradient, large curvature 
Make a smaller stepIteration 2: very small gradient, low curvature 
Make a very small stepIteration 3: very small gradient, low curvature 
Make a very small stepIteration 4: medium-sized gradient, low curvature 
Make a larger step againIteration 5: medium-sized gradient, larger curvature 
Make a small stepIteration 6: reverse direction due to gradient 
Convergence based on gradient â‰ˆ zero criterion
