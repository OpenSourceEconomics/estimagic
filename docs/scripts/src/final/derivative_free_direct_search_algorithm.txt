Initial evaluation: candidate value worse than original value
Do not accept candidate value, switch directionIteration 1: candidate value better than original value
Accept candidate value, increase step lengthIteration 2: candidate value better than original value
Accept candidate value, increase step lengthIteration 3: candidate value worse than original valueDo not accept new point, make step smallerIteration 4: Will eventually converge around here
From iteration 3 we know that we will do worse further right
