Introduction
============

Estimagic is a Python package that helps to build high-quality and user friendly
implementations of (structural) econometric models.

  It is designed with large structural models in mind. However, it is also useful for any
  other estimator that numerically minimizes or maximizes a criterion function (Extremum
  Estimator). Examples are maximum likelihood estimation, generalized method of moments,
  method of simulated moments and indirect inference.

Estimagic is in a very early stage and should not be used for major projects yet.
However, we do encourage interested users to try it out, report bugs and provide
feedback.


Credits
=======

Estimagic is designed and maintained by Janos Gabler (`janosg
<https://github.com/janosg>`_).

However, it has been a collaborative project right from the start.

In particular we would like to thank:

- Klara RÃ¶hrl (`roecla <https://github.com/roecla>`_) for writing most of the dashboard
  code, contributing plots and doing code reviews.
- Tobias Raabe (`tobiasraabe <https://github.com/tobiasraabe>`_) for setting up the
  continuous integration and contributing several bug-fixes and improvements.
- Max Blesch (`MaxBlesch <https://github.com/MaxBlesch>`_) for contributing code for
  numerical integration and calculation of standard errors for GMM and MSM estimators
- Linda Maokomatanda (`lindamaok899 <https://github.com/lindamaok899>`_) for
  contributing code for the calculation of likelihood standard errors
- Moritz Mendel (`mo2561057 <https://github.com/mo2561057>`_) for wrapping the pounders
  algorithm from TAO

If you want to find your name here as well, please contact us or browse through our
Issues and submit a Pull Request.


Installation
============

The package can be installed via conda. To do so, type the following commands in a
terminal:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ conda config --add channels conda-forge
    $ conda install -c opensourceeconomics estimagic

The first line adds conda-forge to your conda channels. This is necessary for conda to
find all dependencies of estimagic. The second line installs estimagic and its
dependencies.

Documentation
=============

The documentation is hosted (`on rtd <https://estimagic.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#>`_)

Citation
========

If you use Estimagic for your research, please do not forget to cite it. Many people
worked on this software and you should recognize their effort.

Roadmap
=======

Estimagic is still in alpha status and the API might still change. We will try
to keep the API more stable When we switch versions `0.0.x` to `0.x.x`. Until
then we want to achieve the following things:

- Fully wrapping scipy.optimize and pygmo, including pygmo's capability for
  parallelized optimizers
- Convenient and robust functions to calculate covariance matrices of
  Maximum Likelihood, GMM, MSM and Indirect Inference estimates.

Afterwards we want to also implement the following extensions:

- Support for general nonlinear constraints for some optimizers
- Confidence intervals based on the profile-likelihood method
