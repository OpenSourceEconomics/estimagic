    """Evaluate first derivative of func at params according to method and step options.

    Internally, the function is converted such that it maps from a 1d array to a 1d
    array. Then the Jacobian of that function is calculated. The resulting derivative
    estimate is always a numpy array.

    The parameters and the function output can be pandas objects (Series or DataFrames
    with value column). In that case the output of first_derivative is also a pandas
    object and with appropriate index and columns.

    Detailed description of all options that influence the step size as well as an
    explanation of how steps are adjusted to bounds in case of a conflict,
    see :func:`~estimagic.differentiation.generate_steps.generate_steps`.

    Args:
        func (callable): Function of which the derivative is calculated.
        params (np.ndarray, pd.Series or pd.DataFrame): 1d numpy array or pandas
            DataFrame with parameters at which the derivative is calculated. If it is a
            DataFrame, it can contain the columns "lower_bound" and "upper_bound" for
            bounds. See :ref:`params`.
        func_kwargs (dict): Additional keyword arguments for func, optional.
        method (str): One of ["central", "forward", "backward"], default "central".
        n_steps (int): Number of steps needed. For central methods, this is
            the number of steps per direction. It is 1 if no Richardson extrapolation
            is used.
        base_steps (np.ndarray, optional): 1d array of the same length as pasams.
            base_steps * scaling_factor is the absolute value of the first (and possibly
            only) step used in the finite differences approximation of the derivative.
            If base_steps * scaling_factor conflicts with bounds, the actual steps will
            be adjusted. If base_steps is not provided, it will be determined according
            to a rule of thumb as long as this does not conflict with min_steps.
        scaling_factor (np.ndarray or float): Scaling factor which is applied to
            base_steps. If it is an np.ndarray, it needs to be as long as params.
            scaling_factor is useful if you want to increase or decrease the base_step
            relative to the rule-of-thumb or user provided base_step, for example to
            benchmark the effect of the step size. Default 1.
        lower_bounds (np.ndarray): 1d array with lower bounds for each parameter. If
            params is a DataFrame and has the columns "lower_bound", this will be taken
            as lower_bounds if now lower_bounds have been provided explicitly.
        upper_bounds (np.ndarray): 1d array with upper bounds for each parameter. If
            params is a DataFrame and has the columns "upper_bound", this will be taken
            as upper_bounds if no upper_bounds have been provided explicitly.
        step_ratio (float or array): Ratio between two consecutive Richardson
            extrapolation steps in the same direction. default 2.0. Has to be larger
            than one. step ratio is only used if n_steps > 1.
        min_steps (np.ndarray): Minimal possible step sizes that can be chosen to
            accommodate bounds. Must have same length as params. By default min_steps is
            equal to base_steps, i.e step size is not decreased beyond what is optimal
            according to the rule of thumb.
        f0 (np.ndarray): 1d numpy array with func(x), optional.
        n_cores (int): Number of processes used to parallelize the function
            evaluations. Default 1.
        error_handling (str): One of "continue" (catch errors and continue to calculate
            derivative estimates. In this case, some derivative estimates can be
            missing but no errors are raised), "raise" (catch errors and continue
            to calculate derivative estimates at fist but raise an error if all
            evaluations for one parameter failed) and "raise_strict" (raise an error
            as soon as a function evaluation fails).
        batch_evaluator (str or Callable): Name of a pre-implemented batch evaluator
            (currently 'joblib' and 'pathos_mp') or Callable with the same interface
            as the estimagic batch_evaluators.
        return_func_value (bool): If True, return a tuple with the derivative and the
            function value at params. Default False. This is useful when using
            first_derivative during optimization.
        key (str): If func returns a dictionary, take the derivative of
            func(params)[key].

    Returns:
        derivative (np.ndarray, pd.Series or pd.DataFrame): The estimated first
            derivative of func at params. The shape of the output depends on the
            dimension of params and func(params):
            f: R -> R leads to shape (1,), usually called derivative
            f: R^m -> R leads to shape (m, ), usually called Gradient
            f: R -> R^n leads to shape (n, 1), usually called Jacobian
            f: R^m -> R^n leads to shape (n, m), usually called Jacobian
        float, dict, np.ndarray or pd.Series: The function value at params, only
            returned if return_func_value is True.
