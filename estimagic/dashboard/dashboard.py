Functions that setup and update the dashboard.

These are the main functions of the dashboard.

The functions defined here are not executed directly.
Instead a BokehServer is setup and run to execute the main function run_dashboard.
The functions to setup and run the BokehServer can be found in server_functions.

The functions to build and update each tab can be found in the respective module.
